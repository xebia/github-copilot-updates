Matt Olson discovered a powerful new GitHub Copilot feature in Visual Studio Code that allows users to set custom instructions to tailor Copilot's suggestions.

The setting `github.copilot.chat.experimental.codeGeneration.instructions` lets you define custom instructions either as text strings or import them from markdown files.

This significantly streamlines workflows by providing consistent context to Copilot across all interactions.
